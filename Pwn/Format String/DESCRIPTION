Format string vulnerabilities are extremely potent in binary exploitation. With a simple mistake, an attacker can achieve both
arbitrary read and write! But this program doesn't allow us to write to any memory region we like, so we can't repoint a
function call to `system('/bin/sh')` in the GOT ... Is it unsolvable??

Note that you might need to write a fuzzer for this challenge.
