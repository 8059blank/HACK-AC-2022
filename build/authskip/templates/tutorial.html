<p>This will be a <strong>guided challenge</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="sql">SQL</h2>
<p>To begin, what is SQL?</p>
<p>SQL stands for structured query language. It is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system. It is particularly useful in handling structured data, i.e. data incorporating relations among entities and variables.</p>
<p>For example, when you sign up for a particular app/service, your details might be added to an SQL database. Then, when you log in, the app might retrieve and validate your details using an SQL statement executed on a database.</p>
<h2 id="sql-injection">SQL Injection</h2>
<p>SQL injection is a code injection technique used to attack data-driven applications, in which malicious SQL statements are inserted into an entry field for execution (e.g. to dump the database contents to the attacker).</p>
<p>SQL injection must exploit a security vulnerability in an application‚Äôs software, for example, when user input is either incorrectly filtered for string literal escape characters embedded in SQL statements or user input is not strongly typed and unexpectedly executed.</p>
<p>SQL injection is mostly known as an attack vector for websites but can be used to attack any type of SQL database. SQL injection attacks allow attackers to spoof identity, tamper with existing data, cause repudiation issues such as voiding transactions or changing balances, allow the complete disclosure of all data on the system, destroy the data or make it otherwise unavailable, and become administrators of the database server.</p>

<h2 id="time-to-learn-how-to-sqli...">Time to learn how to SQLi‚Ä¶</h2>
<p>A statement used to validate user credentials on login might be:</p>
<pre class=" language-sql"><code class="prism  language-sql"><span class="token keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token keyword">FROM</span> users <span class="token keyword">WHERE</span> username <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'wiener'</span> <span class="token operator">AND</span> password <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'bluecheese'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>If it returns an error/nothing, then we know that the user is invalid or has typed the wrong password.</p>
<p>If it returns something, then we know that the credentials are correct.</p>
<p>Here, an attacker can log in as any user without a password simply by using the SQL comment sequence  <code>--</code> to remove the password check from the <code>WHERE</code> clause of the query. This occurs because the <code>--</code> indicates a comment in SQL.</p>
<p>For example, submitting the username <code>admin'--</code> and a blank password results in the following query:</p>
<pre class=" language-sql"><code class="prism  language-sql"><span class="token keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token keyword">FROM</span> users <span class="token keyword">WHERE</span> username <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'admin'</span><span class="token comment">--' AND password = ''</span>
</code></pre>
<p>This query returns the user whose username is <code>admin</code> and successfully logs the attacker in as that user.</p>
<hr>
<p>Another way of logging in is to use <code>1' OR 1=1; --</code> in the password box. This becomes:</p>
<pre class=" language-sql"><code class="prism  language-sql"><span class="token keyword">SELECT</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token keyword">FROM</span> users <span class="token keyword">WHERE</span> username <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'admin'</span> <span class="token operator">AND</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>password <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'1'</span> <span class="token operator">OR</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment">--'</span>
</code></pre>
<p>(Brackets used to show the ‚Äúorder of operation‚Äù)</p>
<p>Even though the password is not  <code>1</code>, <code>1=1</code> is always true and thus the attacker is also successfully logged in.</p>
<hr>
<p>This should have given you enough knowledge to solve this challenge. Try doing the same thing with the vulnerable app (website) given!</p>
<p>Keep in mind that SQL Injection goes much deeper and advanced than this. Keep on learning üíæ!</p>
